# SharkAttackResearch

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE FOR THIS RESEARCH

The objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the presence of sharks during tourist seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters, specifically North Carolina and South Carolina. Our study will focus on the analysis of existing data from the International Shark Attack database, weather and water data from NOAA, calculated moon phase dates, crab and turtle populations. The quantitative analysis on this data will lead to new and interesting knowledge that will provide the basis for an app providing advanced information on the likelihood of sharks in coastal waters where tourists swim, surf and wade.
